Pyramid Finance is a blockchain-based Ponzi scheme simulator. It demonstrates how such schemes operate by allowing users to mint NFTs for a fee and distributing dividends to earlier participants, highlighting the risks and mechanics of Ponzi structures.

## Features:

- **NFT Minting:** Mint NFTs (ponzi share) with 0.25 LAVA.
- **Dividend Distribution:** Early holders benefit from new mints, receiving a return proportional to their place in the pyramid.
- **Instant Payout:** Dividends are distributed in the same transaction a new share is purchased.
- **Educational:** This is tool for demonstrating and understanding Ponzi schemes' dynamics.

## Note:

PyFIN is designed for educational use on evm testnets like Magma, to explore smart contract functionalities without real-world consequences. Engaging with Ponzi schemes is illegal and unethical, leading to financial and legal repercussions. To confirm you've read this, do not go here: https://pondscan.github.io/PyFIN/index.html
